               SHOSHANNA BRAGGISH berates DAVIS EINFRANK about his work in
               science.

                                   SHOSHANNA BRAGGISH
                         How dare you waltz about in front
                         of media cameras--saying that
                         you've solved the way man came to
                         be? Children watch television! Are
                         you trying to brainwash them?

                                   DAVIS EINFRANK
                         Miss...I'm sure I do no more
                         brainwashing than you do with your
                         own children.

                                   SHOSHANNA BRAGGISH
                         Excuse me?

                                   DAVIS EINFRANK
                         Mono-theism, miss. I'm sure you're
                         familiar?

                                   SHOSHANNA BRAGGISH
                         I want nothing to do with your
                         sorcery!

                                   DAVIS EINFRANK
                         That's kind of the joke, isn't it?

                                   SHOSHANNA BRAGGISH
                         I'm not laughing.

                                   DAVIS EINFRANK
                         Right. I guess that's part of the
                         joke, too. Read a book every now
                         and then. It will do your brain
                         good.

                                   SHOSHANNA BRAGGISH
                         I compel you, sir...Keep peddling
                         your blasphemy and the only thing
                         I'll use a book for is to knock a
                         crater in your head.

                                   DAVIS EINFRANK
                         Then go with the King James
                         version, dear. It's the
                         heaviest...both in writing and
                         weight.

               TRENT DODGE grimaces as he watches MOLLY-ANNA VON TISSÉ drink
               herself into a stupor.

                                   TRENT DODGE
                         Miss Von Tissé...I know we're all a
                         bit cramped in this mansion--what,
                         with your voluminous suitcases of
                         couture, and all--but you could do
                         yourself a favor and slow your
                         strangling of the grapes.

                                   MOLLY-ANNA VON TISSÉ
                         Hah...I didn't claw my way to the
                         top without hard work or without a
                         hard-working liver...Don't preach
                         to a madame about how she should
                         drink in the Hamptons, dear. It's
                         in poor taste.

                                   TRENT DODGE
                         I must insist, miss. If you get too
                         drunk I'll have to take it away
                         from you.

                                   MOLLY-ANNA VON TISSÉ
                         Oh? Are you trying to woo me? I
                         haven't ever cared for top-hats and
                         I won't start.

                                   TRENT DODGE
                             (Clears throat)
                         I've watched too many people throw
                         their lives away on "the drink,"
                         and yet you do it like you don't
                         even care.

               Trent starts to lose his cool.

                                   MOLLY-ANNA VON TISSÉ
                         I don't. You're a magician, right?
                         Here's a trick. Watch me make this
                         red stuff disappear!

                                   TRENT DODGE
                         You are an insult to those who have
                         less than you.

                                   MOLLY-ANNA VON TISSÉ
                         That's half the fun of having
                         affluence, my dear.

               Molly-Anna stumbles into a room where CHRIS MATHIAS is
               sitting and reading the paper.

                                   MOLLY-ANNA VON TISSÉ (CONT'D)
                             (Pointing)
                         My God those hands are filthy.

                                   CHRIS MATHIAS
                         I'm sorry? Can I help you?

                                   MOLLY-ANNA VON TISSÉ
                         Do we not have running water?

                                   CHRIS MATHIAS
                         We do?

               Molly-Anna picks up his hand.

                                   MOLLY-ANNA VON TISSÉ
                         Look at those fingernails. The
                         dirt. The grime.

                                   CHRIS MATHIAS
                         Hah. That's part of the job, I
                         guess.

                                   MOLLY-ANNA VON TISSÉ
                         Job?

                                   CHRIS MATHIAS
                         I'm a tradesman, Madam. I'm
                         supposed to install a new security
                         system, but ya'll are here--

               Molly-Anna gasps.

                                   MOLLY-ANNA VON TISSÉ
                         WHAT? Pest! Get away from me.

                                   CHRIS MATHIAS
                         What?

                                   MOLLY-ANNA VON TISSÉ
                         Thief! Criminal! Don't you dare
                         touch me--I have a gun! I'm not
                         afraid of you--

               Molly-Anna runs out of the room.

               Shoshanna berates Trent over his use of magic.

                                   TRENT DODGE
                         I can't believe that vile woman-
                         drunk and...vile.

                                   SHOSHANNA BRAGGISH
                         You're one to talk.

                         Me?

                         All your deception and
                         misguided...hatred!

                         Do we have any towels. That
                         gluttonous, self-absorbed hag is
                         going to get ill--

                         Her drunkenness will always pale

                             (Yelling)
                         Miss! I am trying to mitigate what
                         could end up being a major problem
                         for all of us. Please be quiet!

               Shoshanna stalks behind Trent as he moves about the room.

                                   SHOSHANNA BRAGGISH
                         You will be the one to have to
                         answer to God. What will you say at
                         the holy gates? That you didn't
                         mean to mislead little boys and
                         girls? Why? So you can be famous?

                         I need you all to leave.

                         This late at night? You're insane.
                         What for?

                                   CHRIS MATHIAS
                         I need to install the new security
                         system. If I fail at my job, I'll
                         have to tell my sponsor--I can't go
                         back to jail.

                         I...Stop talking down to me.

               Chris looks like he's about to snap.

                                   DAVIS EINFRANK (CONT'D)
                         I kid--I kid. That was too easy.
                         Why did you go to jail.

                                   CHRIS MATHIAS
                         I couldn't tell you. Wrong place.
                         Wrong time.

                         And so are we--all of us--here at
                         the wrong place...at the wrong
                         time.

                         My life will be, too, if that runt
                         Shoshanna meddles with my
                         equipment. I have half a mind to
                         tie her arms behind her back.
